# hellogallo

This is the source of my personal website. It's built using [quarto](https://quarto.org/), [Docker](https://github.com/analythium/quarto-docker-examples#quarto-examples-with-docker), and deployed via [fly.io](https://fly.io/).

The `website` folder includes the contents for compiling the site, and the output rendered can be found in the `_site` folder.
