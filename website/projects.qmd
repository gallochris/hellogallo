I analyze and visualize data to tell stories about college sports. My work has been mentioned in the [Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/2023/08/29/college-football-made-for-tv-games/) and across [various podcasts](https://youtu.be/O02wsTykC54?feature=shared). 

All data manipulation is done using [R programming language](https://www.r-project.org/).
