    "text": "Four elements on the Dark Horse mindset\n\nKnow your micro-motives\nOur schools and jobs were never designed to help you figure out what whets your appetite\nThese institutions believe in universal motives, but one size doesn’t fit all\n\n\n\nGame of judgment\n\n\nBecome aware when you’re judging someone/something\n\n\nIdentify feelings, vivid reactions, when you’re judging someone/something\n\n\nAsk why you are experiencing those feelings\n\nThe game of judgment isn’t about other people/things at all. It’s about you. It’s all about the details. The specifics.\n\n\n\nMotives can be contradictory\n\nExample: you may want to be around around people and be alone\nDon’t follow your passion\nEngineer your passion\n\n\n\nKnow your choices\n\nBe the same as everyone else, only better - that’s not choosing, it’s picking\nPicking is like using a menu at a restaurant\nChoosing is going to the grocery market and cooking dinner\n\n\n\nChoosing vs Picking\n\nChoosing is an active process\nPicking is a passive process\nThe true power of choice is to find and select opportunities that activate the greatest number of your own micro-motives\n\n\n\nStandardization mindset\n\nLuck isn’t a dark horse strategy\nDark horses are ok with the worst-case scenario too\nWhat separates dark horses is how they evaluate risk\n\n\n\nRisk\n\nStandardization mindset says risk is determined by odds\nDark horse mindset says risk is determined by fit\nBecause if something is a good fit, the opportunity is low risk. If a poor fit, the opportunity is a high risk\n\n\n\nSusan Rogers\n\nShe took a job as a receptionist at a studio\nThe odds say an average person successfully going from receptionist at a studio to musical engineer are low. But Susan said there was a good fit between her motives, so it wasn’t a high risk\nA small difference in fit can lead to a large difference in fulfillment and excellence\n\n\n\nKnow your strategies\n\nStandardization says there is one best way\nThe truth is there are alternatives\nKnowing your strategies is a new way of thinking about the nature of your strengths\n\n\n\nMicro-motives\n\nYour micro-motives are part of your core identity, these are resistant to change\nWhen we want something, we feel it\nYou know with confidence whether you want to go skydiving or eat a plate of eel sushi or watch the latest Marvel movie\n\n\n\nStrengths are the opposite\n\nInaccessible, contextual, and dynamic. Fuzzy\nEverything you label as a strength is a artificial construct or ability\nAbilities like programming or performing ballet are done through effort or learning\n\n\n\nNatural talent\n\nHow naturally gifted are you at riding a hippopotamus?\nThe only way to know is to try\nYou discern your strengths through action, not introspection\n\n\n\nContextual strengths\n\nSay you have trouble reading text\nThat’s a shortcoming if you want to be a literary critic\nIf you want to be an astronomer, it might be an unexpected strength\nIf you have trouble reading, your brain is better detecting images like black holes\n\n\n\nExamples of strengths/weaknesses by context\n\nEmpathy is an asset for a nurse, and a shortcoming for a drone pilot\nBeing tall is good for an NBA player, and bad for a coal miner\n\n\n\nDynamic strengths\n\nImprove with practice, deteriorate through neglect\nYour approach should be different when choosing a strategy than when choosing an opportunity\nIt’s all about trial and error not staying the course or choosing the one best way\n\n\n\nChoosing a strategy\n\nYou should expect failure\nIt’s necessary to develop excellence with strategies\nIt unearths your fuzzy strengths\n\n\n\nWhy know your micro-motives?\n\nWhen you learn to know your micro-motives:\nYou engineer your own passion\nWhich endows you with energy and authenticity\n\n\n\nWhy know your choices?\n\nWhen you learn to know your choices\nYou engineer your own purpose\nWhich provides you with meaning and direction\n\n\n\nWhy know your strategies?\n\nWhen you know your strategies\nYou engineer your own achievement\nWhich gives you a deep sense of pride and self-worth\n\n\n\nIgnore the destination\n\nUnlearn things\nDestinations are catastrophic for fulfillment\n\n\n\nMore on standardized mindset\n\nStandardized time (120 credit hours, MBA, certain degree) is to benefit institutions, not you\nFixed dates makes it easier to assess people\nThis makes you believe that getting better is simply a matter of time\n\n\n\nDark horse mindset says\n\nTime doesn’t matter\nThe correct answer is it depends because time is relative\nDon’t ask how long it takes to master something?\nInstead ask if this the right strategy for me to master something?\n\n\n\nGoals and destinations\n\nIgnoring a destination is not the same as ignoring goals\nA goal emerges out of your individuality\nAn active choice you have made.\n\n\n\nMore on goals and destinations\n\nA destination is someone else’s idea of an objective that you acceded to. It’s always contingent\nFor example, getting into Harvard Law is a destination\n\n\n\nMore on goals and destinations\n\nA goal is winning your next debate club match, reading more philosophy books, and trying to get an internship\nIt’s possible you will end up at Harvard Law. The self-knowledge you gain from these goals will open up new opportunities for you\n\n\n\nGradient ascent\n\nIt’s like climbing to the highest peak\nFirst, you start climbing in the direction of the steepest slope\nNext, you pause and look around to gain a new vantage point to see if that’s the right path to the peak\nIt’s not fast. You repeat this until you reach the peak\n\n\n\nWorld believes in standardization mindset\n\nTalent isn’t rare, there is a talent quota\nThis makes us believe very few have the potential for excellence\nStandardization mindset selects talent\nDark horse mindset is about developing talent\n\n\n\nFairness on talent\n\nA lottery system would be the only way to meet a quota and objectively evaluate candidates\nUse a jagged profile to show that everyone has talent\nQuotas lead to a negative-sum game (you win, I lose, if I win, you lose)\n\n\n\nEquality\n\nAll animals are equal, but some animals are more equal than others\nStandardization qutoacracy, you don’t need talent or hard work to climb the ladder, you need the right family or a fat wallet\nRedefine equal opportunity as equal fit\n\n\nBest version of yourself\n\nA dark horse mindset says your goal is not to become the best in the nation, but to become the best version of yourself\nEqual fit is about guaranteeing individual choice\nAsk if an institutions provide both personalization and individual choice?\n\n\n\n\nExamples\n\nChoice without personalization is picking (food menu)\nSummit Public Schools example: have a dedicated mentor who meets with them one-on-one every week\nSummit uses a lottery system to accept students, everyone has an equal chance\n\n\n\nMore examples in education\n\nSouthern New Hampshire University started College for America\nIt eliminated grades and credit hours, replaced with competency-based evaluations\nEvery student has a mentor helping them make the best educational choice\n\n\n\nSouthern New Hampshire University Example\n\nNo formal instructors, only academic coaches and reviewers\nGreater freedom of choice comes greater personal accountability\n\n\n\nThe book in one sentence\n\nGet better at thing things you care about most"

Assumptions embedded in numbers = fail\nRank assumptions in order by importance and uncertainty (top = most important, least certain = bottom)\nQuickly, with little expense, test validity of most important assumptions and adjust\n\n\n\nResource Allocation\n\nGrove - to understand a businesses strategy look at what they actually do rather than what they say they will do\nOur resources - personal time, energy, talent and wealth\nDifference in prioritizing for immediate returns - promotion, raise/bonus RATHER than long term gains - raising children\nStrategy is created through hundreds of everyday decisions about how to spend your time, energy and money\nNothing but good intentions, unless it’s effectively implemented\nIf the decisions you make about where to invest your blood, sweat and tears are not consistent with the person you aspire to be, you’ll never become that person\n\n\n\nGood and Bad Capital\n\n93 percent of successful companies had to abandon their original strategy (Bhide)\nSuccessful companies succeed because they have money left over after the original strategy fails, so they can pivot and try another approach (Do not spend all your money on original strategy = fail)\nCapital that seeks growth before profits is bad\nImpatient for growth and patient for profits\nHonda succeeded because it was so financially constrained it was forced to be patient for growth while it figured out its profit model\nInvestments in relationships with friends and family need to be made long, long before you’ll see any sign that they are paying off\n\n\n\nDoing the job right\n\nWhat causes us to buy a product or service is that we actually hire products to do jobs for us\nCompany must understand the jobs that arise in people’s lives, then develop products and the accompanying experiences required in purchasing and using the product to do the job perfectly, it causes customers to instinctively pull the products into their lives when the problem arises\n\n\n\nUnderstand the job of the customer\n\nJobs others are trying to do is very different from the jobs that you think he/ she should want to do\nOur effort is often misplaced Work through job-to-be-done lens\nSacrifice deepens commitment\n\n\n\nDanger of Outsourcing\n\nConcept of capabilities - resources, processes and priorities\nDynamic and built overtime\nResources - most tangible, people, equipment, technology, designs, brands, information, cash, relationships with suppliers, distributors and customers\nResources can be hired/fired, bought/sold, depreciated/built\n1 of 3 critical factors driving business\n\n\n\nProcesses\n\nWay which employees interact, coordinate, communicate and make decisions are processes\nEnable resources to solve more and more complicated problems\nIncludes ways products are developed/made, and methods by which market research, budgeting, employee development, compensation and resource allocation are developed\nCan’t be seen on a balance sheet\n\n\n\nPriorities\n\nDefines how a company makes decisions, clear guidance about what a company will invest in or not\nWhat will employees focus on today and what will they not\nCompany’s priorities must be in sync with how the company makes money\nDynamic view of suppliers capabilities - what are they striving to do\nWhat capabilities must stay in house - otherwise you will hand over future of your business\n\n\n\nLearning\n\nPeople learn when they are ready to learn Not when we’re ready to teach them\nNeed to do more then learn new skills, need to be challenged\nNeed to develop values, solve hard problems\nHand over to others (outsource) you are losing opportunities to develop them\n\n\n\nRight Stuff\n\nNot born with superior skills, your the best because you honed them along the way\nExperiences that taught them how to deal with setbacks or extreme stress in high- stakes situations\nAbilities are developed and shaped by experiences in life\nWrestle with the problems you don’t even know you are going to face\nValue of giving people experiences before they need them plays out in many fields other than business\nIf you do not fail along the way, they will not build the resilience to get through life\nExperiences must prepare you down the line\nFind the right experiences to help build skills you need to succeed\n\n\n\nCulture\n\nSchein - a way of working together toward common goals that have been followed so frequently and so successfully that people don’t even think about trying to do things another way. If a culture has formed, people will autonomously do what they need to do to be successful.\nCasual Friday’s, free sodas in the cafeteria, or whether you can bring your dog into the office - just artifacts of culture, NOT real thing\nResult of shared learning = first time when a problem or challenge arises\nExample - How do we deal with customer complaint?\nIf the decision is deemed “good enough” employees return to same decision and way of solving the problem\nEvery time you solve a problem, you are learning what matters\nCreating an understanding of priorites, how to execute (processes)\nA culture is the unique combination of processes and priorities within an organization\nAdvantage allows an organization to become self-managing\nIf environment changes substantially, strength of the culture will make it hard to change things\nCulture is formed through repetition - must reinforce, it will form one way or another\n\n\n\nFull vs. Marginal Thinking\n\nLife comes with no warning signs Case of Blockbuster vs. Netflix\nFailure is the end path of marginal thinking\nWe end up paying the full cost of our decisions, not the marginal\nFull cost of something completely new\nLeverage what already exists\nIf you need a machine and don’t buy it, then you will ultimately find that you’ve paid for it and don’t have it\n100 percent of the time is easier than 98 percent of the time\nInstinct to use marginal costs hides us from the true cost of our actions\nDecide what you stand for and then stand for it all the time\n\n\n\nPurpose\n\nlikeness - what the managers/employees hope they build when they reach each critical milestone on their journey\ncommitment - conversion to likeness that they are trying to create, do not compromise\nmetrics - enable everyone associated to with enterprise to calibrate their work, keep them moving together in a coherent way\nLikeness, commitment, metrics compromise a purpose\nMust deliberately be perceived and chosen, then pursued\nThe Person I want to become Becoming Committed\nFind the right metric\nResolve others challenges rather than your own, do not focus on your problems"

Where they want the real thing, we give them abstract busy work, where they need to find meaning, the schools ask memorization, and discipline becomes divorced from intuition, patterns from parts.”\nwe should teach creativity\n\n\n\nModel of creativity\n\nfour stages: preparation, incubation, illumination, and verification\npreparation: do your homework, research it (left brain)\nincubation: sleep on it, take a walk, reflect (right brain)\nillumination: eureka moment (left and right brain come together)\nverification: confirm your discovery (left brain)\n\n\n\nTrends\n\njust before a trend changes, there will be maximum agreement by experts and others that the trend will not end\nto deal with discomfort of uncertainty, man tends to create a false sense of security by substituting certainty for uncertainty\nirony is that the greater the uncertainty, the greater the similarity of predictions, as the experts “shout” together in the dark\n\n\n\nComedy and Tragedy\n\na comedy is when the characters discover reality in time to do something about it; a tragedy is when the characters do not\nstupidity well packaged can sound like wisdom\n\n\n\nThinking and dealing with uncertainty\n\nsince vision is the most information rich of all senses, visual thinking is extremely important and powerful\nin order to extrapolate what is missing, you need to use the right hemisphere, as it is by far the one best suited to deal with incomplete information\nwatch out for the man whose stomach doesn’t move when he laughs\n\n\n\nInference\n\nto infer is to arrive at a decision or opinion by reasoning from known facts or evidence (e.g., from your smile, I infer that you’re pleased)\nan inference can also be a matter of making connections between events that are not obviously related\nGeneral Patton observed the anomaly of cart tracks and made the connection that the Germans were low on gas; a rather creative and important leap\ninferential thinking, however, is very much whole brained; the left brain stores up the knowledge acquired during the reading so as to provide a background against which the right brain can spot anomalies\n\n\n\nCrisis\n\ncrisis equals danger and opportunity\nAs crisis is comprised of danger and opportunity, those who sense change in the early stages will tend to have the most bountiful harvest\n\n\n\nReading is important for inference\n\nreading serves as a “radar screen” on which the anomalies, or clues of change, first appear\nprovides a feeling for what is normal, as one needs to know normality in order to recognize an anomaly\nbroad-based readings allow one to spot a change in one field that will impact another"

And being smart doesn’t help, it makes it worse\n\n\n\nWhy be Objective?\n\nBecause the more objective we are, the more accurate our beliefs become\nAlmost nothing is black and white, 0 or 100, and that’s pretty good philosophy for living\n\n\n\nHow not What\n\nBetter served as communicators and decision-makers if we thought less about whether we are confident in our beliefs and more about how confident we are in those beliefs\nThis way our expression of confidence would capture all the shades of grey in-between\nIt’s a spectrum, 76% to 63% is much better than right or wrong.\n\n\n\nUncertainty\n\nAcknowledging uncertainty is the first step in measuring and narrowing it\nAny decision is a bet on what will likely create the most favorable future for us.\nSometimes things happen because of the other form of uncertainty - LUCK\n\n\n\nThe Problem\n\nThe way things turn out could be the result of our decisions, luck, or a combination of the two\nQuote: We must believe in luck, for how else can we explain the success of those we don’t like\nGolden rule of habit change - keep the old cue, deliver the old reward, but insert a new routine\n\n\n\nStrive for this\n\nBe a better credit-giver than your peers\nBe more willing than others to admit mistakes\nBe more willing to explore reasons for an outcome with an open mind\nAnd even, and especially, if that might cast you in a bad light or shine a good light on someone else\n\n\n\nWhat to ask\n\nWhy might my belief not be true?\nWhat other evidence might be out there bearing on my belief?\nAre there similar areas I can look toward to gauge whether similar beliefs to mine are true?\n\n\n\nMore ?s to ask\n\nWhat sources of information could I have missed or minimized on the way to reaching my belief?\nWhat are the reasons someone else could have a different belief, what’s their support, and why might they be right instead of me?\nWhat other perspectives are there as to why things turned out the way they did?\n\n\n\nDon’t be a outcome junkie\n\nYou’re going to lose a lot, and win a lot\nYou can always, however, try to make a good bet\nLearn how to navigate the uncertain future because you’ll never be sure of the future\n\n\n\nCUDOS\n\nPrinciples for a good trust group\nCommunism: be a data sharer, more data you share leads to better assessment\nRashomon effect: two accounts of same event, but versions are dramatically different because they’re informed by different facts and perspectives\nYou can’t assume your version of the story is accurate or complete\nUniversalism: don’t shoot the message, imagine if same info came from person you didn’t like\nBoth of these are bad: - negative opinion about person delivering message, we close our mind - positive opinion about person delivering message, we accept without vetting it\nListen to the other side to look for things you agree with, when we do this, we learn things we otherwise wouldn’t have learned\nThe only way to gain knowledge and approach truth is by examining every variety of opinion\nDisinterestedness: telling someone how a story ends encourages them to be resulters\nWe don’t process information independent of the way we wish the world to be\nIf the group is blind to the outcome, it produces higher fidelity evaluation of decision quality\nOrganized skepticism: discussion among the group to encourage engagement and dissent\nLean over backwards to figure out where we could be wrong\nSkepticism is about asking why things might not be true rather than why they are true\n\n\n\nCommunication with a trust group\n\nExpress uncertainty: listen for things you agree with, state those and be specific, follow with and instead of but\nand is an offer to contribute\nbut is a denial and repudiation of what came before\nTry using yes and\n\n\n\nDecision making help\n\nAsk do you want to let it all out or are you thinking about what to do next?\nFocus on the future: we can identify the goals, our problem is the execution\n\n\n\nThe past\n\nRehashing our past can create defensiveness\nIt’s hard to be defensive about something that hasn’t happened yet\nHave you thought about how you would get rid of all this drama in the future?\nExample: child with bad test scores - it must be hard to have a teacher like that, do you think there is anything you can do to improve your grade in the future?\n\n\n\nConsequences\n\nConsequences take awhile to show: what does the intern possibly know?\nIt could take years for that intern to become a successful competitor before that mistake becomes obvious\nImproving decision quality is about increasing our chances of good outcomes, not guaranteeing them\n\n\n\nIn the moment\n\nWhen we make in-the-moment decisions, and don’t ponder our past or future, we are more likely to be irrational and impulsive thinking about the future is remembering the future\nTemporal discounting - favor our present self at the expense of our future self\n\n\n\nRegret\n\nMove regret in front of our decisions: have a loss agreement\nRegret decision of losing lots of chips before you bought more\n\n\n\nThink like this\n\nImagine how future-you is likely to feel about the decision or imagine how you feel today if past-you made the decision how would you feel if you made the decision 10 minutes ago? 10 months ago? 10 years ago?\nThis does two things:\n1 - influences us to make a better decision\n2 - helps us treat ourselves more compassionately\n\n\n\nHow we got there\n\nIt doesn’t so much matter where we end up as how we got there\nOur feelings are not a reaction to the average of how things are going\nWhat is tilt? If you blow some recent event out of proportion and react in a drastic way, you’re on tilt\n\n\n\nLong view\n\nLong view thinking is more rational thinking\nUlysses contract: past-us preventing present-us from doing something stupid\nExamples: take a ride share when going to a bar, automatic allocation into retirement fund\n\n\n\nWhat is wrong?\n\nWrong is a conclusion, not a rationale\nIf we’re going to be self-critical, the focus should be on the lesson and how to calibrate future decisions\n\n\n\nBenefits of scouting the future\n\n1st: scenario planning reminds us that the future is inherently uncertain, more realistic\n2nd: we are better prepared for how we are going to respond to different outcomes that might result from our initial decision, anticipate positive or negative developments instead of being reactive\n3rd: being able to respond to the changing future is a good thing, being surprised by the changing future is not\n4th: less likely to fall for hindsight or resulting bias\n\n\n\nExpected value: Example\n\n$100,000 grant has 25% chance of winning (expected value is $100k * .25 = $25,000)\n$200,000 grant has 10% chance of winning (expected value is $20,000)\n$50,000 grant has 70% chance of winning (expected value is $35,000)\nThis shows that the $50,000 grant is more valuable than the $100,000 and $200,000 grants\n\n\n\nBackcasting\n\nWhen we forecast the future, the present and the immediate future look large, anything beyond that loses focus\nProspective hindsight, imagining that an event has already occurred, increases the ability to correctly identify reasons for future outcomes by 30%\n\n\n\nPremortem\n\nPremortem: imagine a negative outcome\nBackcasting is cheerleader, premortem is the heckler in the audience\nIncorporating negative visualization makes us more likely to achieve our goals\n\n\n\nNegative visualization\n\nWe’re more likely to execute goals if we think about negative futures\nWhy?\nBecause it helps us anticipate potential obstacles and improve our likelihood of succeeding\n\n\n\nTree metaphor\n\nThe trunk of the tree is the past\nBranches are potential futures\nWhen a potential future doesn’t happen, don’t chop it down (give the chainsaw a rest)\n\n\n\nOutcomes and Hindsight\n\nWhen you look into the past and only see what happened, it seems inevitable\nHindsight bias is the enemy of probabilistic thinking"

    "text": "Loss + Risk Aversion\n\nPeople tend to prefer avoiding loss instead of acquiring similar gains\nRisk means you’re operating with incomplete information\n\n\n\nConfirmation Bias\n\nHuman tendency to look for facts and evidence to support your existing beliefs\nPeople put a lot less effort into picking apart evidence that confirms what they already believe\n\n\n\nParadox of Choice\n\nHaving too many choices can be a bad thing\nMaking choices take time and mental energy, often it is better to limit options\n\n\n\nHanlon’s Razor\n\nAlways try to stay above an instant emotional response, especially before you know the other person’s true intentions\nNever attribute to malice that which is adequately explained by stupidity\n\n\n\nAd Hominem\n\nPractice of insulting an opponent personally instead of arguing their position\nI always cheer up immensely if an attack is particularly wounding because I think, well, if they attack one personally, it means they have not a single political argument left.\n\n\n\nEntropy\n\nWithout investing energy things will tend to become more disordered over time\nYou can’t unscramble egg\n\n\n\nTheory of Influence\n\nSix principles\nReciprocity, scaricity, authority, consistency, liking, and social proof\n\n\n\nOccam’s Razor\n\nThe simplest solution is probably the correct one\nThe explanation requiring the fewest assumptions is most likely to be correct\n\n\n\nMurphy’s and Hofstadter’s Law\n\nMurphy’s Law: anything that can go wrong will go wrong\nHofstadter’s Law: It always takes longer than you expect, even when you take into account this law\n\n\n\nCounterfactual Thinking\n\nEvery time you say to yourself “if only i had done…” or “what if…” you are engaging in thinking that is counter to the facts\nBecause the arrow of time only points in one direction it is impossible to realize these different choices\n\n\n\nParkinson’s Law\n\nWithout careful planning tasks will expand in scope and complexity until they are too difficult to accomplish\nWork expands so as to fill the time available for its completion.\n\n\n\nLateral Thinking\n\nLook for new ways to approach a problem to find novel solutions\nDo not seek to follow in the footsteps of the men of old; seek what they sought\n\n\n\nInversion\n\nInstead of setting goals from what you want, try to do the opposite and set anti-goals for what you are trying to avoid\nA lot of success in life and business comes from knowing what you want to avoid\n\n\n\nAddition Through Subtraction\n\nBeing creative is involved in repackaging or reimagining a great idea, simplifying it or applying it to a different purpose\nThe soul grows by subtraction, not addition\n\n\n\nAnecdotal Reasoning\n\nAnecdotal evidence is the story someone tells that provides information or a conclusion\nThe problem with anecdotal evidence is that it takes a single point of view into account\n\n\n\nCorrelation vs. Causation\n\nCorrelation is a mutual relationship between two or more things\nCausation is a relationship of dependence between two or more things\nCorrelation does not equal causation\n\n\n\nTactics vs. Strategy\n\nStrategy describes the goal and how to reach it\nTactics are the specific actions to take on the way to the goal\n\n\n\nThird Story\n\nPutting yourself in the shoes of a neutral, third-party, such as a mediator and telling a story that all parties can agree upon\nWhen you voice your disagreement, begin by talking about what you have in common with the person you are arguing with\n\n\n\nZero Sum Game Theory\n\nWhen one player wins, his opponent loses an equal amount\nIn a zero-sum game, the problem is entirely one of distribution, not at all one of production\n\n\n\nFraming, Anchoring, and Ordering\n\nFraming is the way in which something is defined\nAnchoring deals with setting a reference point for comparison\nOrdering describes how the order that different choices are listed informs a customer’s perception of value\n\n\n\nNash Equilibrium\n\nAssuming that all the players know the rational move that every other player will make, and they will also make a rational move, the game will reach a state of equilibrium\n\n\n\nDunning-Kruger Effect\n\nThose who have low ability do not have the understanding to see they are lacking ability\nConversely, those who performed the best underestimate their ability, assuming that everyone is able to perform at a similar level\nThose who know do not speak, those who speak do not know\n\n\n\nSpacing Effect\n\nSpacing out repetitions over time produces better recall than doing the same number of repetitions over a shorter duration\nStudying is like rowing a boat upstream, not moving forward is to fall behind\n\n\n\nDeliberate Practice\n\nMethod to acheive top performance in a given field\n10,000 hours rule\n\n\n\nGamifaction\n\nAdding a level of competition to something that is already being done in order to improve the outcome\n\n\n\nOpportunity Cost\n\nOpportunity cost is the tradeoff you make when you make a choice\nthe idea that once you spend your money on something, you can’t spend it again on something else\n\n\n\nPygmalion Effect\n\nHigher expectations lead to better performance\nLeaders should make sure people can emerge and grow\n\n\n\nPeter Principle\n\nSatirical concept that individuals within a large organization will continue to be promoted until they reach a job level they are unable to effectively perform\n\n\n\nCircle of Competence\n\nFocus on areas of knowledge and ignore areas you don’t understand\nThe important thing is not how big the circle is, the important thing is staying inside the circle"

    "text": "Acts of Omission\n\nThe absence of an act - as far less harmful than acts of commission - actually committing the act, even if the outcomes are the same or worse\nFood example - declining healthy food is a poor choice (omission), but eating junk food is worse (commission)\n\n\n\nOmission or Comission\n\nJeff Bezos quote - “people overfocus on errors of commission, failure’s not that expensive, the big cost you incur is harder to notice, errors of omission.”\nOfficials or refs, when the game steps up, you step down\n\n\n\nSubjective calls\n\nSwallow the whistle with judgement calls versus subjective calls when the game is about to end\nSubjective in football - holding, illegal blocks, illegal contact, and unnecessary roughness don’t happen as often when game is on the line or at its end\nObjective calls - delay of game, illegal formation, motion, or shift are called at the same rate\n\n\n\nGo for it\n\nKevin Kelley always going for it on 4th down and never punting\nHe plays the odds and he also has job security and freedom to do so\nAll about risk aversion\n\n\n\nLosing hurts\n\nSparky Anderson - losing hurts twice as bad as winning feels good.\nWould you rather want a $5 discount or avoid a $5 surcharge?\n\n\n\nWhy take risks\n\nYou’re more likely to risk something when you expect to lose\nJob security is huge. Are you allowed to fail or be unconventional?\nBelichick was not as aggressive until he won a Super Bowl. It built equity for him to take risks, fail, and not lose his job\n\n\n\nLaRussa example\n\nPlayers must buy in too.\nTony LaRussa tried using pitchers for 3 innings apiece, but players didn’t like it. They wanted wins (throw for 5 innings), because it drives their contracts\n\n\n\nWesthead example\n\nPaul Westhead’s playing style at Lakers, didn’t work\nIt worked at Loyola Marymount, but failed spectacularly with Denver Nuggets\nPlayers buy in matters.\n\n\n\nTiger Woods is human\n\nMore about loss aversion, it’s a principle we dislike losing a dollar more than we enjoy earning a dollar\nPGA tour, measured putts from identical distance for birdies and pars, putts for par were far more successful\nPlayers were so concerned with a loss, you’re more aggressive in avoiding bogey than scoring birdie\n\n\n\nBirdie putts\n\nTendency to leave putts short for birdie, being too conservative.\nWoods even says the psychological difference between making a birdie and dropping a shot is huge, more important to make a par putt. He’s human\n\n\n\nGain and loss\n\nIn the face of gain, we’re conservative\nIn the face of loss, we’re aggressive.\nIt’s hard to block out how you got in a predicament. Remain even keel\n\n\n\nEndowment effect\n\nFeel the loss of something you own much more deeply than the loss of something you don’t own\nWhen you own, you’re invested emotionally in a thing versus not tied to it\n\n\n\nOffense wins Championships\n\nDefense is no more important than offense, both are equally important\nDefense requires effort, it’s less glorified, harder to measure, and dark (hidden)\n\n\n\nValue of a blocked shot\n\nThe value of blocked shots is in the details.\nBlocked shot back to opponent was assigned a value\nBlocked shot out of bounds was slightly more valuable\nBlocked ball to a teammate was worth the most\n\n\n\nValue of the act\n\nIt’s the value of the act, not the act itself that matters\nCounting is easy, measuring value is hard\nTim Duncan’s 149 blocks were more valuable than Dwight Howard’s 232 blocks\n\n\n\nRounding first\n\nPeople have a bias to round numbers\nIt’s why more batters hit .300 than .299.\nA batter is close to .300 at end of season? He won’t play.\n\n\n\nIncentive bias\n\nA rounder number (100 RBI, .300) usually leads to better salary\nBobby Abreu finished with exactly 20 or 30 home runs five times, seven times exactly 100 or 100 RBI, and no seasons with 95 to 99 RBI\nSame true in NFL with 1,000 rushers\n\n\n\nWhere to find value?\n\nYou can find value in looking at players just below these round number benchmarks\nJust below .300 or below 1,000 rushers\n\n\n\nRooney Rule\n\nThe drop-off of African American coaches winning is actually a good thing\nWhy? It validates the Rooney rule\nBlack coaches are held to same standard as white counterparts. They’re equal\n\n\n\nComforts of Home\n\nThere is a home-field advantage in all sports\nIt’s a bit more strong in some sports, but it’s the same regardless of where sport is played\nThere is significant incentive to win at home - concessions, people leave happy, spend more money\n\n\n\nWhy does home field advantage exist?\n\nBecause of crowd support? No. Look at kicks in football, free throws, shootouts - when you control for a situation where crowd could impact game, it really doesn’t\nBecause of travel? No, evidence isn’t strong that travel plays a major role.\nBecause of scheduling? Yes.\n\n\n\nScheduling\n\nNBA teams play lots of back-to-back games, and this does favor the home team\nIt’s less of an issue in certain sports like MLB\nMore extreme in college football. Teams pad schedule with hosting weak opponents\n\n\n\nHome field advantages\n\nScheduling bias explains some of home field advantage, but not in baseball or NFL or soccer at all\nBecause of unique home characteristics? Not really, some impact, but not huge difference. Hard to really have an edge with unique home fields today\n\n\n\nOfficials\n\nOfficials or referee bias is most significant factor\nStudy used QuesTec data to determine officials or umpires side with the home team in pressure situations on borderline calls\nMore ambiguous the call? More likely to go in home team’s favor.\nHumans conform because they want to fit in and because they believe the group is better informed than they are\nOfficials aren’t really aware of the bias, it’s just a natural human response\nWhy does home field advantage differ across sports?\nBecause refs or officials are more important or have more influence on the game. Soccer more than baseball. A penalty kick is huge, where umpire calls are fairly black and white.\nWhy is it the same for a sport no matter where its played?\nBecause the role of the referee is the same no matter if soccer is played in America or Europe or Spain.\nWhy hasn’t it changed much over time?\nBecause the officials role hasn’t changed with the rules.\n\n\n\nNo I in team\n\nBut there is an m and an e\nThere is a bigger influence of superstars in certain sports like basketball\nDisagree with soccer, think it’s much less\nMakes sense in basketball. Only 5 players play at a time\n\n\n\nMichael Jordan\n\nWhere in baseball, a player might only get 3 at-bats a game\nIn soccer, only a few touches by your best attacker.\nMichael Jordan - There is an I in win. So which way do you want it?\n\n\n\nNFL Trades\n\nOff the chart Mike McCoy came to own the NFL draft using a value chart that was largely designed off assumptions.\nTried to answer - what is the value of a draft pick in a certain round?\nValue of the first pick in draft was 3000, and first pick in second round 580, and final pick was 0.4\n\n\n\nCharts give value\n\nThe chart just gave the Cowboys a framework\nIt more or less stated value in multiple picks versus one high pick\nOpposite is when the Saints traded eight draft picks for Ricky Williams. Overpaid by a ton\n\n\n\nWhy did it become obsolete?\n\nEventually when all teams started using the chart, it became obsolete\nThaler and Massey found inefficiencies\nTeams would overpay to pick today versus playing the long game. Not comfortable with uncertainty\n\n\n\nEvaluating Talent\n\nIt takes talent to evaluate talent.\nDraft pick value is different for different sports. Seven rounds in NFL, just two in NBA, and 50 in MLB\nFind value by looking at the details. Ask why\nBrady didn’t play at Michigan more because of political reasons than his ability\n\n\n\nRule Changes\n\nCoin toss trumps all: If you won the coin toss in overtime for NFL, you win 61 percent of time\nThis prompted changes in the NFL overtime rule. It wasn’t really fair\n\n\n\nMitchell Report\n\nWhat isn’t in the Mitchell Report Dominican players were more likely to take steroids because of cultural and situational needs\nAll incentive bias\nThe upside was far greater for Dominican players than American players. A lot of Dominicans were much younger, where American players were older and trying to get one last big contract\n\n\n\nDoes icing the kicker or shooter work?\n\nNo. It’s a lukewarm strategy.\nStudy looked at NFL kicks and NBA free throws. Found no difference in performance\n\n\n\nMyth of the hot hand\n\nMomentum in sports doesn’t exist. We just believe it does because we like patterns\nWe don’t like mystery.\nRandomness and luck resist explanation\n\n\n\nLuck\n\nTry flipping a coin 100 times. There will be streaks of heads or tails\nThose streaks don’t increase the odds the next flip will land on heads.\nWe do a really poor job at understanding randomness. You aren’t due for anything. Your chances do not change because of a streak.\n\n\n\nSample sizes and Randomness\n\nThe true quality of teams can be measured in large sample sizes\nSmall samples are dominated by randomness\n\n\n\nStatistics\n\nYou can make numbers say whatever you want. It’s selective. And more than one thing can be true\nBe objective. Neutral. Look at as much data as possible to get a more accurate picture\nNot just short-term numbers\n\n\n\nCubs cursed?\n\nNo, they’re not cursed or super unlucky.\nIt was deeply ingrained in the team that wins and losses didn’t matter\nWrigley wanted fans to enjoy the ballgame, win or lose. Lovable losers\nCubs could lose and attendance could go up. This wasn’t the case for almost all other teams.\nBeer prices remained flat. Cubs fans went to game for experience, not for wins.\nCurses aren’t to blame or Steve Bartman.\n\n\n\nPurpose of the book\n\nIgnore data and diverse views as your own peril\nSeek controversial or opposite opinions and challenge convention to improve your decision making"

    "text": "Standard of Performance\n\nWalsh’s version based off the Standard of Excellence book (In Search of Excellence by Peters and Waterman)\nPromote internal communication that is open and substantive\nBe deeply commited to learning and teaching, be fair\nHonor the direct connection between details and improvement, relentlessly seek improvement\n\n\n\nCulture\n\nPeter Drucker said culture can eat strategy for lunch\nManage the culture, wins would take care of themselves\nCan’t cookup success unless you have the right culture\n\n\n\nScouting/Players Development\n\nSee players not as a collection of data and stats, but in context of schemes they run\nIt’s lazy to grade a player without understaning the player’s role\nScout inside out, not outside in - analysis is informed by detailed understanding of each position defined by the scheme\n\n\n\nQualities of a Leader\n\nCommand - the room, the message, and one’s self\nSophocles said all men make mistakes, but a good man yields when he knows his course is wrong and repairs the evil. The only crime is pride\nUltimate sign of strength is personal accountability\nShare credit and blame alike\n\n\n\nCommand of opportunity and process\n\nBob Seger told Glenn Frey - to make it in this business, he would have to write his own songs. Frey asked, but what if they’re bad?\nSeger told him - of course, they’re bad. Just keep writing until they’re good\nSame is true as a coach, you learn on the fly\nWhen rules don’t apply to everyone, it causes chaos\n\n\n\nAl Davis: Scouting\n\nOur job is to find talent, not dismiss it - be professional\nBackground of a draft pick is valuable - Al Davis loved good high school players because what if their collegiate production was squandered by poor coaching or a mismatch in talent/scheme\nFocus on the level of competition - huge variation of talent in college—from program to program and conference to conference—and how not being able to compare apples to apples impacts draft evaluations\nDavis was drawn to players who were at their best against the best\n\n\n\nEvaluating talent\n\nConfirmation bias: eager to see what we want\nRemember to never begin with the end in mind\nDon’t get caught up in groupthink\nYou can’t bullshit an NFL lockeroom - players know who is good and bad, who the favorites are\nBest teams force players to prove their value\n\n\n\nCharacter assessment\n\nAssessing character is a challenge: too many vairables\nSliding scale of what is right and wrong\nCharacter can only be assessed face-to-face\n\n\n\nBelichik’s secrets\n\nPerforms an autopsy after every season - clean slate for all, no one is grandfathered in\nHow to tweak how we teach - take the lesson from the meeting room to the classroom to the field\nConnect emotionally on the field, but also be objective in GM decisions\nEveryone can have an opinion as long as there is data, insight, or experience to support it\n\n\n\nTeam building\n\nEvery team has a list, but Belichik’s is a living/changeable document\nNeeds change as injuries happen and skill increases, can’t ignore that\nContentment is the enemy\n\n\n\nAll-in mentality\n\nSpecial teams are the heart and soul of a team\nHerb Brooks, USA Hockey - gave all the players a test, goalie Jim Craig refused to take the test\nBefore Olympics, Brooks told Craig he might bench him and Craig though it was because he wouldn’t take the test\nBrooks said - no, it’s because I want the guy back that wouldn’t take the test - the fire/motivation\n\n\n\nQuarterback play\n\nWalsh belives the feet were more important than the arm\nQuick feet, quick arm. Balanced feet, balanced arm. Coordinated feet, coordinated attack.\nTiming was everything - spacing and rhythm, it was synchronized\nOffense was about preserving the lead than establishing it\nWinning (and losing) are habits - Parcells’ golden rule was a QB that had at 23 wins in college\nYards per attempt - shows what a quarterback is seeing and where he’s looking\nThick skin - how do you react when something doesn’t go your way?\nFootball smarts - study and work, but also how fast can you process information\n\n\n\nDefensive Principles\n\nBelichik is not much for change, but believes in adaptation\nDisguise is as important as defense - base that tweaks play to play based on strengths/weaknesses\nNew plays don’t win consistently, but using old plays in new ways does\nLearn how an offense works: how, when, where, and why every player on the field moved during every play\nDetails over everything - inches in an offensive lineman’s split stance are important\nTeach defense, don’t just coach it\nMake the offense play left-handed - take offense out of their comfort zones by preventing them from doing what they do best\n\n\n\nRemember Newton’s Second Law\n\nBelichik likes speed: wants his team doing, not wondering what to do, reacting, not thinking\nHates mistakes, but if they happen it’s because his team is going fast and doing, not slow and confused\nPressue first, sacks second - be strategic, save certain pressure for the second half\n\n\n\nFour-point plays\n\n3rd downs in the red zone are four-point plays - difference between a touchdown and field goal\nForce teams to take small, harmless gains - this bring impatience and gets them to make a mistake\n\n\n\nMiddle Eight\n\nFinal four minutes of first half and first four minutes of second half\nKeep offense off the field by controlling the back at end of first half and getting the ball to start the second\nThis means you get more possessions or chances to win\n\n\n\nTalking is Winning\n\nTalking is winning, especially on defense\nBelichik removed numbers on players jerseys in practice because he wanted them to talk more during plays\n\n\n\nPlayoff gameplanning\n\nExperience is not preparation.\nHaving previously played in a playoff game means nothing.\nBelichick’s guide (1) what his team does well (2) what it doesn’t do well (3) what he thinks it will take to win the playoffs in a particular year\n\n\n\nHidden yards\n\nYards that don’t show up in stat sheet\nExample: a gunner on the punt team fighting through three blocks to down the ball at the 1 instead of letting it bounce into the end zone for a touchback. It won’t show up on the stat sheet, but that guy just saved the Ravens 19 yards in a game that will be determined by inches.\n\n\n\nOpportunity period\n\nGiving practice reps to backups because it might happen\nColts didn’t believe that - Peyton Manning took all the reps - we don’t practice fucked, bad idea\nAllow players to be ready\n\n\n\nThinking ahead\n\nYou’re playing against the clock too: each play takes six seconds, 54 seconds = 9 plays\nMaximize the number of yards you can get, don’t check down\nWorld class pool players make a shot and where they leave the cue ball matters almost as much as pocketing the ball\nMissed field goals are turnovers because after a miss, you lose possession and yards\n\n\n\nNoticing coverages and matchups\n\nAll a QB cares about is the middle of the field open or closed?\nCheck where safeties are - open or back, means middle of field is vulnerable - closed or forward, means ball likely going to sidelines\nIf a wideout is in motion and someone follows him, it’s man-to-man coverage - if not, it’s zone coverage\n\n\n\nBorn to run theory\n\nKey to success is repetition, 10,000 hours of practice\nBut that gets boring - don’t get bored, Springsteen plays Born to Run a lot\nBest remedy for boredom is reading and research\n\n\n\nQuotes\n\nTo live in the past is to die in the present.\nJ. Roscoe Miller said: I have two kinds of problems: the urgent and the important. The urgent are not important and the important are never urgent.\nWalsh on three F’s of decision making: firmness, fairness, fast."
