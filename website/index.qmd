My name is Chris, and I help teams build useful software. My job is to understand what customers and teammates are trying to do, and guide them to progress.

I'm the former head of customer support at [Highrise](https://medium.com/@natekontny/moving-on-from-highrise-94fb26df67e7). Our small team shipped product improvements, self serve tools, and documentation to help hundreds of thousands of people do business across the world. 

Today, I'm a product manager at [Zipline](https://getzipline.com/). Our team helps retail employees do their job. Over a quarter of a million people use Zipline to improve store execution.
