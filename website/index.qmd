My name is Chris. I build, manage, and support software products. 

Today, I'm a sales engineer at [Zipline](https://getzipline.com/). We help retail employees do their job. Over a quarter of a million people keep today on track by using Zipline.

Outside of work, I enjoy analyzing and visualizing data to answer questions.
